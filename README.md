# SweetFactory
This is a small tool for updating a Java Applet to make it easier to transpile with JSweet.

Written in C# using Windows Forms it parses a Java Applet file and generates an updated Java file ready for transpiling into Typescript\Javascript. The project was created in Visual Studio and utilises a .T4 template.
